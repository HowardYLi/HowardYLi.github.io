Hi! My name is Yuanhao (U-an-how) Li and I go by Howard. I use the pronouns he/him/his. I am currently a second-year PhD student at the University of Rochester Brain and Cognitive Sciences. I work with Dr. Michele Rucci at the [Active Perception Lab] (https://aplab.bcs.rochester.edu/). My research focuses on visual perception under the presence of eye movements. We look at how saccades and ocular drift modulate retinal image power in the way that benefits our perception, using approaches including high-resolution eye-tracking, human psychophysics, and modeling of neural systems. This will lead to a better understanding of how the human visual and oculomotor system work. If you are interested, feel free to reach out and discuss science with me!

## About this Site

This project is a slight customization based off of some great work by 
  [NC State University Libraries](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/).
  The original project, called [`jekyll academic`](https://ncsu-libraries.github.io/jekyll-academic-docs/)
  has its own [github repository](https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/jekyll-academic)
  and [workshop documentation](https://ncsu-libraries.github.io/jekyll-academic-docs/workshop/). 


## Creating Your Own

To see a step-by-step guide to build your own site, go to the [RESEARCH](/research) section. 
  There you'll find a basic [guide](/blog/getting-started) that will help you
  create your new site.
