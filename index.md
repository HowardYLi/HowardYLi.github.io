excerpt: "About Me..."

Hi! My name is Yuanhao (You-an-how) Li and I go by Howard. I use the pronouns he/him/his. I am currently a second-year PhD student at the University of Rochester Brain and Cognitive Sciences. I work with Dr. Michele Rucci at the [Active Perception Lab](https://aplab.bcs.rochester.edu/). My research focuses on visual perception under the presence of eye movements. We look at how saccades and ocular drift modulate retinal image power in the way that benefits our perception, using approaches including high-resolution eye-tracking, human psychophysics, and modeling of neural systems. This will lead to a better understanding of how the human visual and oculomotor system work. If you are interested, feel free to reach out and discuss science with me!

## About me

Outside lab work, I enjoy video games, board games, manga, sci-fi and many other nerd things. Recently I am into Apex Legend, Doctor Who, Franken Fran, and Jojolion (the list goes on). I also love reading and thinking in philosophical terms. Some of my favorite authors are Albert Camus, Hermann Hesse, and Osamu Dazai.
