excerpt: "About Me..."

Hi! My name is Yuanhao (You-an-how) Li and I go by Howard. I use the pronouns he/him/his. I am currently a third-year PhD student at the University of Rochester Brain and Cognitive Sciences. I work with Dr. Michele Rucci at the [Active Perception Lab](https://aplab.bcs.rochester.edu/). My research focuses on visual perception under the presence of eye movements. We look at how saccades and ocular drift modulate retinal input in the way that benefits our perception, using approaches including high-resolution eye-tracking, human psychophysics, and modeling of neural systems. This will lead to a better understanding of how the human visual and oculomotor system work. If you are interested, feel free to reach out and discuss science with me!

## About me

Outside lab work, I enjoy reading, video games, board games, sci-fi, among other indoor activities. Every once a while I have a urge to learn something new but then never spend time practicing it. Right now that something is bass.
